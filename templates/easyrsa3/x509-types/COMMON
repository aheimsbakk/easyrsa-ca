# X509 extensions added to every signed cert

# This file is included for every cert signed, and by default does nothing.
# It could be used to add values every cert should have, such as a CDP as
# demonstrated in the following example:

#crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://example.net/pki/my_ca.crl

{% if easyrsa_ca_crl_uri is defined %}
crlDistributionPoints	= URI:{{ easyrsa_ca_crl_uri }}
{% endif %}
{% if easyrsa_ca_crt_uri is defined %}
authorityInfoAccess	= caIssuers;URI:{{ easyrsa_ca_crt_uri }}
{% endif %}
